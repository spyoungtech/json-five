## Installation

```
pip install json-five
```

This project requires Python 3.6 or newer.

## Usage

**NOTE:** the import name is different from the install name (sorry, many were taken already)

```python
>>> import json5
>>> json_text = """{ // This is a JSON5 comment
"foo": "bar" /* this is a JSON5 block
comment that can span lines /*
"bacon": "eggs"
}
"""
>>> json5.loads(json_text)
{"foo": "bar", "bacon": "eggs"}
```

You can also use `json5.tool` for validating json.

```
python3 -m json5.tool < myfile.json5
```
As of right now, there is no formatting on the output; original whitespace and comments is maintained. 
In the future, pretty-printing, stripping comments, and other options may be added.

## Key features

- Supports the JSON5 spec
- Supports similar interfaces to stdlib `json` module
- Supports round-trip preservation of comments
- Tries to find _all_ syntax errors at once (instead of raising on the first error encountered)


## Status

This project currently fully supports the JSON5 spec but is still undergoing active development, particularly for round-trip support and model-level edits. Additional features are still being added. Check the [issues](https://github.com/spyoungtech/json-five/issues)
page to see known bugs and unimplemented features.
